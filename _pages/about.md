As a highly motivated software engineer, I have been fortunate enough to work in a number of projects with other highly competent developers, as well as other free lance ventures. These opportunities have not only allowed me to hone in on my ability to solve technical problems, but they have also made me a better communicator in group settings, and a more effective team player.
