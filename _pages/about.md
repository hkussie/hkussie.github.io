As a highly motivated software engineer, I have been fortunate enough to work in a number of projects with other highly competent developers, as well as other free lance ventures. These opportunities have not only allowed me to hone in on my ability to solve technical problems, but they have also made me a better communicator in group settings, and a more effective team player.

Throughout my time in college, I have not only acquired knowledge regarding fundamental computer science topics (algorithms, data structures, etc.) I have also acquired skills in the most relevant front and backend frameworks such as Flask, and Django. I feel that these skills have not only made me more effective at addressing the needs of clients, but addressing the technical needs of the teams that I will be working on.

As an enthusiastic and self-motivated professional, I welcome the opportunity to talk to you about how my experience and skills would benefit your company. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
